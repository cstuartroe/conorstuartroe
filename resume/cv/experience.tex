    {Full-Stack Software Engineer}
    {Academia.edu}

    {July 2020-Present}
    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Academia.edu's stack is Ruby on Rails, React (with TypeScript), and Postgres}
        \item {My role is truly full-stack - I have worked on projects ranging from data engineering to page redesigns according to business needs}
        \item {
          A large proportion of my work has pertained to the payments system,
          including writing a webhook to handle Stripe events, building a new datastore
          of historical exchange rates, and converting our complex
          frontend payments code from JavaScript to fully annotated TypeScript
        }
        \item {
          I spend 10-20\% of my engineering time with the cybersecurity guild, a group of
          engineers that spend time away from their normal teams to work on dependency updates,
          credentials safety, and site security
        }
        \item {
          I have been giving tech screens for Academia.edu since early 2021 and have also
          onboarded two new hires
        }

        \item {
          As Lead Developer, I supported the larger PR and marketing operation by building bespoke

        }

          I did all technical design and planning and led one other engineer in implementation
