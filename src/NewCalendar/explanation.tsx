            <h3>Years</h3>

            <p>
              Years begin around the March equinox, on March 20, 21, or 22 of the
              Gregorian calendar. Year 1 in this calendar would have begun in March of
              3346 BCE, a fairly random year I picked because it's around the advent of
              written history. Here are the New Years' Days for the next 10 years:
            </p>

            {this.dateTable(
              addDays(new Date(), -365),
              365*11 + 3,
              (d) => d.day.season !== -1
            )}

            <h3>Seasons and special days</h3>

            <p>
              The year is broken into the four standard seasons, each of which begins with an equinox or
              solstice. Because seasons are not the same in the northern and southern hemispheres,
              I have declined to officially label the seasons as "Spring", "Summer", "Autumn", and
              "Winter", and named the equinoxes and solstices "First" and "Second" rather than anything
              denoting a particular ecological season (although I obviously used colors and iconography suggestive of
              seasons in the temperate northern hemisphere in this web app - my cultural bias is showing!&nbsp;ðŸ˜ )
            </p>

            <p>
              Seasons each begin with an equinox or solstice and then have three 30-day months, adding to 91 days.
              These four 91-day seasons plus a single New Years' Day (falling the day before the First Equinox) add
              to 365 days.
            </p>

            <p>
              This calendar has leap years with the same rules as the Gregorian calendar - if the year number
              is divisible by 4, unless it is divisible by 100, unless it is divisible by 1000. The leap day
              is inserted halfway through the year, just before the second equinox.
            </p>

            <h3>Month names</h3>

            <p>
              I independently decided that I quite like the idea of a twelve-month year aligned with solstices
              and equinoxes, and subsequently decided that the clearest naming convention would be to use the
              predominant existing method of splitting the year in this way - the Western astrological zodiac.
              This is not meant to imply any particular relationship with horoscope or divination practices
              based on Western astrology.
            </p>

            <h3>The week</h3>

            <p>
              The 30-day months are split into three 10-day weeks. The weekdays are named after the seven classical
              planets, plus "Earth", "Star", and "Sky"; the weekday names in order are:
              Sunday, Moonday, Mercuryday, Venusday, Earthday, Marsday, Jupiterday, Saturnday, Starday, and Skyday.
              That's right - there's an Earth Day every week!
            </p>

            <h3>Time</h3>

            <p>
              I've always found it weird that time is the only dimension that the metric system never touched. It makes
              sense that dividing a day into years will be messy; 365 is not a particularly clean or round number in
              base 10. But the number of divisions within a day is completely arbitrary - hours, minutes, and seconds
              are not meant to approximate any natural unit of measure.
            </p>

            <p>
              As such, I've combined this particular calendar system with metric time, a scheme which divides a single
              day into 10 hours, hours into 100 minutes, and minutes into 100 seconds. Metric hours are equal to 2.4
              standard hours, metric minutes to 1.44 standard minutes, and metric seconds to 864 standard milliseconds.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have a long-standing and well-known dislike of daylight savings and time zones, and have used neither
              here. Midnight is aligned with UTC.
            </p>

            <h3>Extended calendar</h3>

            <p>
              Just for ease of reference, here's all days one year in the past and future:
            </p>

            {this.dateTable(
              addDays(new Date(), -365),
              365 * 2 + 1,
              _ => false
            )}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
